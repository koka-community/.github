This is intended to be a space where we can share code so others can easily find it, and explore some core APIs prior to integrating into the koka standard library

We should aim for most libraries to have a MIT license by default so that it is very permissive, with the understanding that the license will change to whatever Koka needs if the library gets integrated into the standard library.

Anyways, let's start a discussion on community guidelines, expectations, important / desired community libraries [here](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka/discussions/497), and simultaneously we can start building and contributing. 

Also, if you want to read more info about some less documented features of Koka check our community docs out [here](https://koka-community.github.io/koka-docs/koka-docs.kk.html)

Let one of the community admins know if you are interested in contributing! (Shoot us a message on Discord).
